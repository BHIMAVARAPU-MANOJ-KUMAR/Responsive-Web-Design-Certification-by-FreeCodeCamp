# Responsive-Web-Design-Certification-by-FreeCodeCamp

The FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course is designed to teach the fundamental languages used to create webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design. Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect from the course:

# Basic HTML and HTML5: You’ll start by building a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.

# Applied Visual Design: Learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

# Responsive Web Design Principles: Understand how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

# Projects: The course includes hands-on projects to apply what you’ve learned and build a portfolio of work.

The course is structured to provide a thorough grounding in responsive web design, culminating in an assessment where you’ll complete practical projects. 
It’s a free course offered by freeCodeCamp, a donor-supported tax-exempt organization dedicated to helping people learn to code.
